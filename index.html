							<p>This portfolio features Python projects from my Introduction to Programming I course. I earned a 4.0 in this notoriously difficult weeder course and was offered a
								position as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant due to my in-depth understanding of the material and the guidance I regularly provided to my recitation team. Personal projects will be added in the future.

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/paris.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>I'm a Computer Science student focused on gaining hands-on experience and growing personally and professionally.
								Guided by a motto of self-reflection, self-discovery, and self-improvement, I enjoy applying my interests in software engineering,
								AI, cybersecurity, and productivity to solve real-world problems and help others grow.
							</p>

							<p>As a Security Analyst Intern at Jackson’s Security Operations Center, I’ve investigated 900+ phishing emails using threat intelligence tools
								(e.g., malware scanners, header analyzers, IP data providers) to protect company stakeholders from social engineering attacks. I’ve identified and
								escalated business email compromises that helped safeguard over $600k in client assets and was entrusted with training two new interns, combining my technical experience and teaching ability.
							</p>

							<p>As an AI Trainer, I evaluated and fine-tuned 10+ large language models (text-to-text and text-to-image) using prompt engineering strategies like few-shot learning
								and chain-of-thought prompting. I optimized model outputs using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and conducted peer QA reviews to ensure safety, consistency, and model alignment.
							</p>

							<p>As a Controls Engineer Intern at Lear Corporation, I discovered and resolved a code bug in PLC ladder logic, prompting a company-wide investigation. I prepared technical reports and presentations
								for engineers and upper management, analyzed camera data to improve seat assembly processes, and developed a PFMEA contingency plan to ensure continuity in seat-shipping across 30+ trailers.
							</p>

							<p>As President of my university's NSBE Chapter, I secured 97% support for my presidency and assembled the first fully staffed board since 2019. I implemented a task-management system and streamlined
								communication processes, supporting initiatives that led to multiple awards, including Outstanding Professional Organization of the Year, Outstanding Academic Organization of the Year,
								and 2nd Place for NSBE Region IV Chapter of the Year.
							</p>
								
							<p>As a STEM Tutor for TRIO Student Support Services, I led 30+ tutoring sessions in calculus and programming. I taught study strategies like active recall, spaced repetition, and the Feynman Technique
								while introducing tools like Notion and the Pomodoro Method to support time management and independent learning.
							</p>
								
								
							<p>At the KPMG Future of Tech Summit Case Competition in Orlando, FL, I collaborated with a cross-disciplinary team to develop a solution for community carbon neutrality,
								delivering a compelling presentation that led us to place as finalists.
							</p>
								
							<p>Connect with me to discuss shared interests or internship opportunities.</p>
